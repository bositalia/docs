You can play around with the HTTP endpoints directly on your installation, under [`localhost:1865/docs`](http://localhost:1865/docs).
You will find there most of the documentation you need, alongside code snippets in various languages and a useful playground to try them out.  

## Examples

![Alt text](../../assets/img/production/end_example2.png){ width="500" }

![Alt text](../../assets/img/production/end_example3.png){ width="500" }

![Alt text](../../assets/img/production/end_example4.png){ width="500" }


Check out also the the community [client libraries](clients.md).

When you feel ready you can also create [custom endpoints](../../plugins/endpoints.md) direclty in your plugins.
